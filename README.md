# CSS Cat Art

## Description
- This project is a picture of a cat made with Html and CSS. It's a way to practice and get better at using CSS.

### Important Concepts:
- In CSS, :first-child and :last-child are pseudo-classes that allow to target elements based on their position within their parent element's list of children.
- Similarly, ::before and ::after are pseudo-elements that allow you to insert content before and after the content of an element, respectively.
